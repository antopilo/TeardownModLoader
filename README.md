To see if it works, hope in game. If you see a notification saying spam. 
The mod loader is working and is loading the spam mod.

# How to uninstall mods
Remove the `using "yourmod.lua"` in the modloader.lua
Remove everything in the tick() init() related to your mod

## How to use(make mods)
Open modloader.lua to see how the spam mod is being loaded.
The spam.lua mod should be used as a template on how to load your custom lua scripts.
Create a new file in the `mods` folder that ends with `.lua`. 

Let's say `debug.lua`.

In your debug.lua file you should have at least 3 functions.
1. `debuginit()`
2. `debugtick()`
3. `debugdraw()`

*NOTE*: you should name them using the filename you used. could be `fastcarinit()`
Just make sure no other mod use the same function name as yours.

Open the mod loader and add at the top of the file: `using "mods/debug.lua"`

Then in the modloaderinit() add: `debuginit()`
In the modloadertick() add: `debugtick()`
In the modloaderdraw() add: `debugdraw()`

You are now free to code away any mods you want using this procedure.
